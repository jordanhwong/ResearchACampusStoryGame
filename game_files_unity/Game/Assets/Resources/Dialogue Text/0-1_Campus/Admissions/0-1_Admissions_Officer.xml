      <page>It looks like your only class today is an Intro to Research class, held in the Lecture Hall.</page>
      <page>Make sure to head to your dorms and talk to your RA before you go to class today.</page>
      <page>Your RA will be able to give you more information about the class and where the lecture hall is.</page>
