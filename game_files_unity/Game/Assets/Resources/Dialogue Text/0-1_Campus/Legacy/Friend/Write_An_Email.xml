      <page>That email will definitely get the attention of Professor Watson!</page>
      <page>Don't forget though...</page>
      <page>Don’t be afraid to email a few different Professors.</page>
      <page>Just make sure you tailor each email for different positions!</page>

  <page>Professors are crazy busy, so don’t get discouraged if they don’t respond quickly...</page>
  <page>If at all!</page>
  <page>When this happens, don’t be afraid to send multiple emails!</page>

      <say>Really?</say>

  <page>Yeah!</page>
  <page>Before you go sending a ton of emails though, can I see the original email you sent?</page>

  <page>That’s NEVER going to get a reply!</page>
  <reply>
    <option>
      <say>Why not?</say>
    </option>
  </reply>
  <page>Well...</page>
  <page>Professors get a ton of emails and usually won’t respond to someone who may waste any of their time.</page>
  <page>You basically have to show the Professor that you take them seriously.</page>
  <page>If you do that then they’ll take YOU seriously!</page>

      <say>State interest.</say>
      <page>Perfect! Your introduction should always include why you’re interested in the project.</page>
      <page>Research projects can be pretty competitive...</page>
      <page>So it’s good to show the professor that you’re actually interested in the project itself.</page>

      <page>Easy there! You should at least introduce yourself first!</page>

      <page>By establishing the purpose of your email...</page>

      <page>Yeah!</page>

      <say>Close email.</say>

    <option>
      <say>Ask to meet.</say>
      <page>Perfect!</page>
      <page>Asking what time works best for a meeting is a great way to make sure you’re being courteous to the Professor’s schedule.</page>
      <page>It also shows that you’re serious about the position and are being proactive.</page>
    </option>
    <option>
      <say>[HELP]</say>
      <page>We’ve established the purpose of the email...</page>
      <page>But it’s always good to encourage the professor to respond to your email by asking a question.</page>

    <option>
      <say>"Thank you for your time,"</say>
      <page>Not bad!</page>
      <page>Thanking the professor for their time is a very polite way to close an email.</page>

  <page>Okay, let's check out this email now...</page>
  <page>...</page>
  <page>...</page>
  <page>...</page>
  <page>Perfect!</page>
  <page>This is sure to get their attention now!</page>
  <page>Go to the computer in the computer lab and send this off!</page>
  <page>Don’t forget though...</page>
  <page>Don’t be afraid to email a few different Professors!</page>
  <page>Just make sure you tailor each email for each position!</page>
