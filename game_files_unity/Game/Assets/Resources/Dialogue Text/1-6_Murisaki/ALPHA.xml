      <page>We have arrived in the Heian period of Japan! </page>
      <page>From my calculations we are in either the late 10th century or the early 11th century. </page>
      <page>Somewhere around the 1000s.</page>
      <page>My visionary receptors show that we're near the Heian palace, which is in present day Kyoto, Japan!</page>
      <page>You're off to find Murasaki Shikibu.</page>
      <page>Famous author of The Tale of Genji and The Diary of Lady Murasaki.</page>
      <page>There are a lot of people here...</page>
      <page>So my scanners can't locate her exactly... </page>
      <page>But oh look! There's a book just on that table behind you.</page>
      <page>Maybe that will be of use to you?</page>

      <say>Tell me about Murasaki Shikibu. </say>
      <page>She is regarded as the worldâ€™s first novelist, writing about the court life of Heian period Japan.</page>
      <page>Murasaki Shikibu is a pseudonym used by the writer of The Tale of Genji.</page>
      <page>Although the author's real name is unknown, many speculate that the author may have been Fujiwara no Takako.</page>
      <page>For the time period, a female writer would have been largely unheard of.</page>
      <page>Despite this, we know that Murasaki Shikibu, and other ladies of the court were taught to read and write Japanese.</page>
      <page>The Tale of Genji was most likely written for fellow members of the court to read as entertainment.</page>
