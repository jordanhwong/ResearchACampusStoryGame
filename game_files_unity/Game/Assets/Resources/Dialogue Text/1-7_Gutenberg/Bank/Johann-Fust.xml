      <say>Johannes Gutenberg has sent me to humbly request you reconsider the loan offer.</say>
      <page>Oh he has?</page>
      <page>And why is it that Mister Gutenberg, his greatness, cannot grace the bank with his presence?</page>
      <page>Sending a messenger in his stead?</page>
      <say>Mister Gutenberg feels too much shame to come before you.</say>
      <say>He offers a set of playing cards hot off the press.</say>
      <page>What's that? Let me see...</page>
      <take item="Printed cards" count="1"/>
      <page><color hex="74f442">[The printed cards have been removed from your inventory]</color></page>
      <page>How... interesting.</page>
      <page>The Master of Playing Cards made another set!</page>
      <page>Mister Gutenberg knows I'm an avid collecter of these cards...</page>
      <page>These are exquisite.</page>
      <page>...</page>
      <say>So...</say>
      <page>...</page>
      <page>... Mister Gutenberg has demonstrated his aptitude.</page>
      <page>Although Mister Gutenberg has been in some financial trouble before, if he continues to print more like these cards, I can see a profit in his future.</page>
      <page>Tell him that I will give him the loan tomorrow. I will be by around noon to talk about the details.</page>
      <page>I want to hear more about this “printing press” of his.</page>
