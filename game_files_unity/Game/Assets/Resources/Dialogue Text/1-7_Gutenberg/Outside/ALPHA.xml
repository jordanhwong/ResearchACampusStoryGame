      <page>We have arrived in Germany! </page>
      <page>We should have arrived just before Johannes Gutenberg begins his work on the printing press!</page>
      <page>Exciting stuff!</page>
      <page>If my timing is correct, and why wouldn't it be, I believe that we've landed approximately right when he is about to acquire a loan from a banker.</page>
      <page>Off you go! See what you can learn from Johannes Gutenberg.</page>

      <say>Tell me about Johannes Gutenberg. </say>
      <page>Gutenberg was famous for making a printing press with movable types.</page>
      <page>It was completely new for the time, and will go on to revolutionize the world.</page>
      <page>Previously, literary works would have to be transcribed by hand.</page>
      <page>This invention allowed for the written word to be much more accessible to people around the world!</page>
