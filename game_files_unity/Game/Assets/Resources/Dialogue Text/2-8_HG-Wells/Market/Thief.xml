      <page>That's free my friend, here!</page>
      <say>*gulp*</say>
      <say>Ahhh, thank you!</say>
      <say>I needed that!</say>
      <page>So, are you with that research camp?</page>
      <say>Research camp?</say>
      <page>Yeah, the camp just east of here.</page>
      <page>They've been investigating the nearby ruins.</page>
      <page>Their money is good so I can't complain.</page>
      <page>You should stop by and talk to that H.G. fellow.</page>
      <page>H.G. Wells was it?</page>
      <page>Ah, I can't remember.</page>
      <page>Also, there has been a string of burglaries recently, so keep an eye on your belongings.</page>

      <say>Hey...</say>
      <say>I know you're the one behind all those burglaries! </say>
      <page>What! </page>
      <page>You don't have any proof!</page>
      <say>The family that has been paying you to not steal from them said they'll turn you in if you don't tell me where my machine is.</say>
      <page>I have no idea what you're talking about...</page>
      <page>Besides! Who would believe a traveler like you?</page>
      <page>You have no power here!</page>
      <say>I know where you've been hiding your stolen goods...</say>
      <say>They're in that dried up well just north of here.</say>
      <page>What?!</page>
      <say>I'll lead everyone in the market to the well and tell them you're the one behind the thefts!</say>
      <say>Unless...</say>
      <page>What! I'll do anything!</page>
      <say>Return my machine and no one gets ratted out, you hear?</say>
      <page>But...</page>
      <page>But...</page>
      <page>I don't have it anymore!</page>
      <page>I sold it to some traveling bandits and they're already taking it to be melted down!</page>
      <page>Please don't tell anyone about what I've done!</page>
      <page>I promise I'll stop!</page>
      <say>A likely story...</say>
      <say>You had just better watch out from now on...</say>
      <say>I'm going to see what H.G. Wells has to say about you...</say>
