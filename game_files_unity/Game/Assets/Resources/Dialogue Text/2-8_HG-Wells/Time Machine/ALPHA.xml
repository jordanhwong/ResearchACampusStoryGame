      <say>What is it?</say>
      <say>Are we even in ancient Egypt?</say>
      <page>Of course we are! Look, that's the Nile right there!</page>
      <say>Then what's the problem?</say>
      <page>Well it seems that we over shot the ancient part by a few...</page>
      <say>...</say>
      <page>Centuries...</page>
      <say>Are we in the future?!</say>
      <page>Nothing like that!</page>
      <page>It's just that we're sometime around the 1920s...</page>

      <page>Hey, at least we got here in one piece!</page>
      <say>Which way is town?</say>
      <page>Leaving so soon??</page>
      <say>Yes...</say>
      <page>Well, just head south for a while and there should be a market selling food and drinks!</page>

      <say>Where were you?!</say>
      <page>The time machine was stolen when you went into town!</page>
      <say>I know! I came back and you were gone!</say>
      <page>It wasn't my fault!</page>
      <say>Don't you have some sort of cloaking device or something?!</say>
      <page>Don't be silly, that doesn't exist!</page>
      <say>...</say>
      <say>So you mean it's just been luck that we haven't been spotted before this?</say>
      <page>Luck, maybe.</page>
      <page>I'd say it was my good hiding spots!</page>
      <page>Remember all the cupboards?</page>
      <say>It all makes sense now...</say>
      <say>So how did you get away?</say>
      <page>Oh, I just time traveled away once I got the chance.</page>
      <say>Wait...</say>
      <say>...</say>
      <page>Hmm?</page>
      <say>Why didn't you just time travel to BEFORE we wasted all of our time here?</say>
      <page>Oh, huh...</page>
      <page>Why didn't I think of that?</page>
      <say>Do you know how much stress I felt searching for you?!</say>
      <say>Look, look at my hair!</say>
      <say>It's already turning grey!</say>
      <page>Huh, would you look at that--it is!</page>
      <say>Hey!</say>
      <page>Well, I'm safe. You're safe. Shall we return back to campus then?</page>
      <say>I think that would be smart...</say>
      <say>I wouldn't want anyone to steal you again...</say>
      <page>Oh, did you meet with H.G. Wells?</page>
      <say>Oh yeah! He was actually pretty helpful in all this.</say>
      <say>He said all of this sounded like a book.</say>
      <page>You don't say...</page>
      <say>Wait, how did you know he was here?</say>
      <page>Bio-scans!</page>
