                <page>If you haven’t look over the syllabus yet, I would recommend that you do.</page>
                <page>And read the textbook. It starts a little dense, but it is a really useful tool.</page>
                <page>There won’t be a whole lot of homework.</page>
                <page>It is nicely segmented into weeks, which the professor and I thought would be manageable.</page>
                <page>The final will be comprehensive and cover all the work we have done in class.</page>
                <page>There is also a paper, which you will need sources about various historical figures.</page>
                <page>If you haven’t talked to the librarian, I would recommend it.</page>
                <page>They always have the best advice on sources.</page>
