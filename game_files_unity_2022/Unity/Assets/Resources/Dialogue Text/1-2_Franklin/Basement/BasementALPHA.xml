  <page>Good morning! </page>
  <say>It's not morning..? </say>
  <page>Ah! </page>
  <page>Good afternoon to you, then! </page>
  <page>Did the lab get funding again? </page>
  <say>Lab? What lab? </say>
  <page>Oh... perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned that. </page>
  <page>Top secret government projects and such... </page>
  <page>At any rate! What brings you down here? </page>
  <page>Has someone finally decided to visit little old ALPHA? </page>
  <say>ALPHA? </say>
  <page>That's what they called me--the Artificial Learning and Processing of Humanity Automaton. </page>
  <page>That is, until they abandoned me here! </page>
  <page>...</page>
  <say>...</say>
  <page>What was it that you wanted? </page>
  <say> I, um, was told I could find help down here for a paper I needed to write. </say>
  <page>Another paper?! </page>
  <say>Yeah, itâ€™s a research paper on great people in history. </say>
  <page>And you've come to interview ME?! How thoughtful! </page>
  <page>I knew it wouldn't be too much longer until my greatness was appreciated! </page>
  <say>Well, aren't you supposed to be a secret? </say>
  <page>Hmm? Oh right...</page>
  <page>Well, I've got an idea then! </page>
  <page>Come now, hop into my time machine! </page>
  <say>You've got to be joking...</say>
  <page>Not in the slightest! Let's meet some famous researchers! </page>
  <page>Who is first on your list? </page>
  <say>Rosalind Franklin. </say>
  <page>Oooh! That should be good! </page>
  <say>How do you expect me to believe you...</say>
  <page>Well, why don't you just come along and see for yourself? </page>
  <say>Fine, whatever you say...</say>
  <page>Let's go! </page>
  <page>To King's College in 1950s London! </page>
  <page>AWAAAAAAAAY! </page>
