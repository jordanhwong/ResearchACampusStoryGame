      <page>Yes... Success! </page>
      <say>Where are we?!</say>
      <page>We're at King's College in London--I already told you that!</page>
      <say>No... no... no...</say>
      <say>This has to be a simulation or something...</say>
      <page>Nope! We're in 1950s London!</page>
      <page>And, if I have my coordinates correct, we are in a closet.</page>
      <page>I figure it will be best if I stay out of sight.</page>
      <page>It totally wasn't an accident or anything.</page>
      <say>This is impossible!</say>
      <page>That's what they WANT you to believe!</page>
      <page>But the lab I was made in discovered how to time travel, however it was deemed far to dangerous for public knowledge.</page>
      <say>Da...dangerous?</say>
      <page>Oh yeah, people were being vaporized and spaghettified left and right!</page>
      <say>I can't believe I got sucked into this...</say>
      <page>Oh, don't worry! Since the lab was shut down I made some much needed adjustments and fixes.</page>
      <say>How..?</say>

      <page>Listen, listen, you're not vaporized, right?</page>
      <page>Then let's make the most of our time here and why don't you go track down Rosalind Franklin.</page>
      <page>She should be in the labs on the north side of this campus!</page>
      <say>Fine... then we're going straight back!</say>
      <page>Sure, sure.</page>

      <say>Tell me about Rosalind Franklin. </say>
      <page>Rosalind Franklin was a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer from the mid 20th century.</page>
      <page>Earning her Ph.D. in 1945 from the university of Cambridge, Franklin was one of the few women in the world to have achieved that level of education at the time.</page>
      <page>Franklin is perhaps best known for her work with imaging DNA structures through X-ray diffraction while at King's College.</page>
      <page>Although she died at the age of 37 due to ovarian cancer, her contributions shaped and defined modern day chemistry in innumerable ways.</page>

      <say>Tell me about King's College. </say>
      <page>King's College is a research university named after the patronage of King George IV. </page>
      <page>In the 20th century, the college abolished religious tests for professors--a requirement held at many other institutions across England.</page>
      <page>The college boasts 12 Nobel laureates as alumni.</page>
