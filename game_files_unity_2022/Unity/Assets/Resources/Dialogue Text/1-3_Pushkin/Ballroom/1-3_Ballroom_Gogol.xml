      <say>I was sent by Alexander Pushkin to ask if you would be interested in contributing to his paper.</say>
      <say>He mentioned that he is a long time admirer of your work.</say>
      <page>Let me see that.</page>
      <page><color hex="74f442">[Pushkin's draft of The Contemporary has been removed from your inventory]</color></page>
      <page>I see, I see.</page>
      <page>I don’t know...</page>
      <say>Is there anything I can do to encourage you to contribute?</say>
      <page>Let me look over this a bit.</page>
      <page>The Tsarina has been complaining about her misplaced slippers all evening, so if you could appease her I would be able to concentrate on this paper much more.</page>
      <say>Where is she?</say>
      <page>Sitting on the couch just to the left of the Ballroom entrance.</page>

      <page>Resolve the Tsarina’s issue?</page>
      <say>Yes.</say>
      <page>You know, the story of the Tsarina’s slippers is quite interesting...</page>
      <page>I could imagine a play about that... hmm...</page>
      <page>Anyway, after looking over this paper from Pushkin, I think I my work would fit in wonderfully with his!</page>
      <page>Think of it, a literary magazine. How enticing!</page>
      <page>The Contemporary is quite a fitting name as well!</page>
      <say>This is wonderful news! I’ll return to Alexander Pushkin and inform him.</say>
