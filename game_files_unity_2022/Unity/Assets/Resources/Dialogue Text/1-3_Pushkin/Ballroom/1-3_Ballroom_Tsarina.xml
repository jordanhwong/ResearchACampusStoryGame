      <page>An absolute tragedy!</page>
      <say>What happened?</say>
      <page>I went to go change into my leather slippers and they’ve vanished!</page>
      <page>I’ll have to end the evening early so my slippers can be found!</page>
      <say>I can help you find them.</say>
      <page>Oh you can?!</page>
      <page>I would be eternally grateful if you found any information about them!</page>
      <page>From what I heard, a suspicious man was last seen in the courtyard.</page>
      <page>No one recognized him, and he didn’t have the gait of a nobleman.</page>
      <page>Start your search there</page>
      <say>On it!</say>
