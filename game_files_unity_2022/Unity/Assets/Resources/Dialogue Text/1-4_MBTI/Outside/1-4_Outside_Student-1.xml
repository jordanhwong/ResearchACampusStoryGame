      <page>I’m really glad I got accepted to this school, but I don’t know if I’m prepared for the Michigan winter…</page>
      <page>Maybe I should have gone to a Florida school.</page>

      <say>Yep!</say>
      <say>You are considered an “ISTJ” type. </say>
      <say>That stands for Introversion + Sensing + Thinking + Judgement.</say>
      <say>You tend to be organized, handle criticism well, and are a good listener.</say>
      <say>However, you tend to be rigid and have difficulty getting in touch your feelings.</say>
      <page>Hmm… I suppose I’m not too surprised.</page>
      <page>I would imagine it was my rigidity in my studies that got me admitted to this school.</page>
      <page>Sometimes your weaknesses can actually be your strengths!</page>
      <page>It’s good to know what my weaknesses and strengths are though, so I can make better adjustments to my day-to-day life to live a more fulfilled life.</page>
      <page>Thank you for stopping by and telling me all that.</page>
